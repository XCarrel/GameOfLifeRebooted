# GameOfLifeRebooted

The principles of the game of life twisted out of the grid of the original game in a simplistic js code:
- A bush is a collection of leaves
- At each cycle, we count the number of overlapping leaves for each leaf
- Too many overlaps -> the leaf chokes to death
- Too few overlaps -> the leaf dies of loneliness
- Survivors grow
- A leaf that is too big splits into children
